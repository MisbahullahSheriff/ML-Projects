# Diabetes - Prediction

* The aim of this project was to train a Machine Learning classifier to be able to accurately predict if an individual has diabetes or not.
* The classifier was trained on a dataset comprising of 2000 observations with 9 variables (including the target).

* [*Model Deployment Repo*](https://github.com/MisbahullahSheriff/Diabetes-Predictor-Deployment)

### Algorithms Used:
* Initially various classification algorithms were tested:
* Depending on performance, a couple of classifiers were selected for further optimization:
  * _**Random Forest Classifier**_
  * _**Gradient Boosting Classifier**_
* Finally even an ensemble of the two classifier was evaluated.
* Model evaluation method: **cross-validation**.
* Model evaluation criteria: **accuracy**.

### Libraries Used:
* Pandas, Numpy, Sci-kit Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
